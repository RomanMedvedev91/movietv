# [Movie TV](https://rm-movietv.netlify.app/)

Find out your favourite movies, tv-shows or actors and discover details about it by seeing trailers, posters. Read the overview, find out movie's budget, tvshow's creators and networks, person's credits, recomended movies or tv-shows.

This project is React based front-end application using [MovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
It was designed from scratched in figma and developed utilizing Axios, React router 6, reusable components, CSS, styling components, react semantic UI library, eslint.

During the project, I faced several obstacles such as dynamic nested routs, useUrlParams structure with axios, showing placeholders while fetching data and many more. I resolved them all, which made me feel more confident with react, APIs, react-router, axios, css.
